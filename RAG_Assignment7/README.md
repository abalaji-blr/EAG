# Search Assistant

## Objective:

Build a Chrome plugin that:

For every web page that you visit (skip confidential ones like Gmail, WhatsApp, etc), builds a nomic embedding (or any other model that you can run) and then builds an FAISS index with URL
Please remember that you only need the index file, so you can do it on Google Colab and then download this index file as well
When you search within your plugin, it opens the website where that content is and highlights it as well!
