# Session9 Assignment

## Objective:
Start with the code shared. Your task is: <br>
   1. Fix an "error" in the framework, which will not allow you to run other queries shared in "agent.py" <br>
   2. Write 10 Heuristics that run on the query and results. Think of "removing banned words", etc. <br>
   3. Index your Past Historical Conversation and provide it to Your Agent. Do this very smartly, a lot of scores for this. <br>
   4. decision_prompt_conservative.txt has 729 words. Reduce it to less than 300 without breaking performance. <br>

## Submission
### Bug Fix
1. The error was for the queries - the tool always gets into FURTHER_PROCESSING_REQUIRED. So, the fix is in loop.py,
   along with the user_input provide **user_input_override**. This will help in multi-step iterative processing.
   
   The code changes are [available here](./core/loop.py#L178). <br>
   
   The following are the outputs for the queries. <br>
   1. Find the ASCII values of characters in INDIA and then return sum of exponentials of those values.<br>

### Heuristics that run on the query and results
These heuristics are implemented as a pipeline that processes both incoming queries and outgoing results. They would help:
1. Ensure content safety and appropriateness
2. Maintain quality standards
3. Protect sensitive information
4. Optimize processing based on query complexity
5. Provide confidence metrics for results
6. Enforce rate limiting and resource management
7. Validate content types and formats
8. Filter out inappropriate or banned content
9. Ensure URL safety
10. Maintain result relevance

The complete source code file with [heuristics is available here](./core/loop.py)

```
def check_content_length(text: str, min_length: int = 10, max_length: int = 30000) -> bool:
    """Ensure content is neither too short nor too long""" 
    return min_length <= len(text) <= max_length
    
def filter_banned_words(text: str, banned_words: set) -> str:

    words = text.split() 
    filtered_words = [word if word.lower() not in banned_words else "[REDACTED]" for word in words]
    return " ".join(filtered_words)
 
def validate_url(url: str) -> bool:
    """Check if URL is safe and follows proper format"""
    try:
        result = urllib.parse.urlparse(url)
        return all([result.scheme, result.netloc]) and result.scheme in ['http', 'https']
    except:
        return False

def classify_query_intent(query: str) -> str:
    """Classify query into categories like: mathematical, informational, financial, educational"""
    # Use existing intent classification from perception.py

    return is_allowed

def validate_content_type(content: str, expected_type: str) -> bool:
    """Ensure content matches expected type (text, number, URL, etc.)"""
    if expected_type == "number":
        return content.replace(".", "").isdigit()
    elif expected_type == "url":
        return validate_url(content)
    return True

def filter_sensitive_info(text: str) -> str:

    # Count number of operations/conditions
    complexity = 0
    if "and" in query.lower(): complexity += 1
    if "or" in query.lower(): complexity += 1
    if "not" in query.lower(): complexity += 1
    return complexity

def calculate_confidence_score(result: str, sources: list) -> float:

### Indexing your Past Historical Conversation for Agent

This indexing system allows the agent to:
* Learn from past interactions
* Reuse successful approaches
* Avoid repeating mistakes
* Provide more consistent responses
* Build on previous knowledge

Available Tools:
 * **get_current_conversations**: Retrieves interactions from the current session
* **search_historical_conversations:** Searches through all historical conversations
* **get_conversation_context**: Gets formatted context from relevant conversations

The complete [source code is available here](./modules/mcp_server_memory.py)

1. Indexing System (MemoryStore class)
```
   class MemoryStore:
       def __init__(self):
           self.conversation_index = {}  # Stores semantic index
```
2. Index Creation

```
   def _create_conversation_index(self, memory: Dict) -> Dict:
       index_entry = {
           "query": memory.get("user_query", ""),
           "intent": memory.get("intent", ""),
           "final_answer": memory.get("final_answer", ""),
           "timestamp": memory.get("timestamp", ""),
           "tags": memory.get("tags", []),
           "tool_calls": [
               {
                   "tool": call.get("tool", ""),
                   "args": call.get("args", {}),
                   "result": call.get("result", "")
               }
               for call in memory.get("tool_calls", [])
           ]
       }
       return index_entry
```
3. Index Update Process:
```
   def _update_conversation_index(self):
       all_memories = self._list_all_memories()
       for memory in all_memories:
           if memory.get("type") == "run_metadata":
               session_id = memory.get("session_id", "")
               if session_id:
                   self.conversation_index[session_id] = self._create_conversation_index(memory)
```
4. Relevance Scoring:
The system uses a weighted scoring system to find relevant conversations:

```
   # Query match: 40% weight
   if query.lower() in conversation["query"].lower():
       relevance_score += 0.4
   
   # Intent match: 30% weight
   if query.lower() in conversation["intent"].lower():
       relevance_score += 0.3
   
   # Tag match: 10% weight
   for tag in conversation["tags"]:
       if query.lower() in tag.lower():
           relevance_score += 0.1
   
   # Tool result match: 20% weight
   for tool_call in conversation["tool_calls"]:
       if query.lower() in str(tool_call["result"]).lower():
           relevance_score += 0.2
```
5. Context Retrieval:
```
   def get_conversation_context(self, query: str) -> str:
       relevant_convs = self.get_relevant_conversations(query)
       context = []
       for conv in relevant_convs:
           conversation = conv["conversation"]
           context.append(f"Previous Query: {conversation['query']}")
           context.append(f"Intent: {conversation['intent']}")
           context.append(f"Answer: {conversation['final_answer']}")
           context.append(f"Tools Used: {[call['tool'] for call in conversation['tool_calls']]}")
           context.append("---")
       return "\n".join(context)
```

You are a reasoning-driven AI agent that generates structured execution plans using available tools.

üîß Tools: {tool_descriptions}

üß† Query: "{user_input}"

üìö Historical Context:
{{await mcp.call_tool('get_conversation_context', {{"input": {{"query": user_input}}}})}}

üìè RULES:
- Write async def solve() with ONE FUNCTION_CALL
- Use tool names as strings: await mcp.call_tool('tool_name', input)
- Include tool docstring before each call
- Parse results: json.loads(result.content[0].text)["result"]
- Return: 'FINAL_ANSWER: ' or 'FURTHER_PROCESSING_REQUIRED: '
- For documents/webpages, use FURTHER_PROCESSING_REQUIRED
- No explanations, only Python code
- Consider historical context when planning

‚úÖ Examples:

   1. Basic Tool Chain:
   python
   import json
   async def solve():
       # FUNCTION_CALL: 1
       """Convert to ASCII. Usage: input={{"input": {{"string": "INDIA"}}}}"""
       input = {{"input": {{"string": "INDIA"}}}}
       result = await mcp.call_tool('strings_to_chars_to_int', input)
       numbers = json.loads(result.content[0].text)["result"]
       return f"FINAL_ANSWER: {{numbers}}"
   
   2. Document Processing:
   python
   async def solve():
       # FUNCTION_CALL: 1
       """Extract webpage. Usage: input={{"url": "https://example.com"}}"""
       input = {{"url": "https://example.com"}}
       result = await mcp.call_tool('extract_webpage', input)
       return f"FURTHER_PROCESSING_REQUIRED: {{result}}"
   
   üí° Key Points:
   - Use one tool if sufficient
   - Return FINAL_ANSWER for direct results
   - Use FURTHER_PROCESSING_REQUIRED for documents/webpages
   - Chain tools only if necessary
   - Consider similar past queries and their solutions
