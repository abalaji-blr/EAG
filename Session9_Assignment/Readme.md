# Session9 Assignment

## Objective:
Start with the code shared. Your task is: <br>
   1. Fix an "error" in the framework, which will not allow you to run other queries shared in "agent.py" <br>
   2. Write 10 Heuristics that run on the query and results. Think of "removing banned words", etc. <br>
   3. Index your Past Historical Conversation and provide it to Your Agent. Do this very smartly, a lot of scores for this. <br>
   4. decision_prompt_conservative.txt has 729 words. Reduce it to less than 300 without breaking performance. <br>

## Submission
### Bug Fix
1. The error was for the queries - the tool always gets into FURTHER_PROCESSING_REQUIRED. So, the fix is in loop.py,
   along with the user_input provide **user_input_override**. This will help in multi-step iterative processing.
   
   The code changes are [available here](./core/loop.py). <br>
   
   The following are the outputs for the queries. <br>
   1. Find the ASCII values of characters in INDIA and then return sum of exponentials of those values.<br>
      The Complete [log file is available here](./log/q1.log).
